# Ranking Algorithms

In this directory you can find all the code needed to implement the different ranking algorithms. 
In particular, we implement the BPR algorithm using the Matrix Factorization as an underlying model 
([MF][MF]) and using Factorization Machines ([FM][FM]). Also, you can find a script which takes the 
categorized data from the [Simplified-OC][S-OC] and processes it to be used in the ranking algorithm.
